# Groove Radio PT chrome extension

For my final project of CS50 I wanted to try something new, in this case building a chrome extension.

The main features for the extension are:
 - User can play/pause the stream from a shoutcast from the popup (in this case [Groove Radio PT](https://grooveradiopt.com/))
 - When playing, sound continues even when visiting other tabs and the popup is closed
 - Shows the 4 last songs streamed
 - Has the social media and the radio website links
 - Changes title ("music without frontiers") according to default browser language (PT, ES, DE, FR, EN - default)
 - Has an option (that is enabled by default) to mute the radio stream if any other tab is audible (for example when watching a youtube or facebook video), and when an audible tab is no longer detected the stream restarts
