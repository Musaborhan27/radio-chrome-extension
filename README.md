# Groove Radio PT chrome extension

For my final project of CS50 I wanted to try something new, in this case building a chrome extension.

The main features for the extension are:
 - It plays the stream from a shoutcast (in this case groove radio PT) even when visiting other tabs and the popup is closed.
 - Shows the 4 last songs streamed
 - Has the social media and the radio website links
 - Has an option (that is enabled by default) to mute the radio stream if any other tab is audible (for example when watching a youtube or facebook video), and when an audible tab is no longer detected the stream restarts
